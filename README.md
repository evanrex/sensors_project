# sensors_project

Research into the efficacy of using ML regression techniques to predict the output of water quality sensors.

We use slurm to run our experiments. See the [sbatch file](https://github.com/evanrex/sensors_project/blob/main/model/cluster_job.sbatch)  for reference.

The results of our experiments are stored in the [results](https://github.com/evanrex/sensors_project/tree/main/model/results) folder.
